# Flutter Assignment

## Project Overview

This project is a Flutter-based application designed to replicate a Figma design with a modern and responsive user interface. The app is built using **Flutter**, leveraging the power of **Flutter ScreenUtil** for responsive design and **GetX** for efficient state management and routing. It is a structured and scalable codebase aimed at providing an intuitive user experience.

The design and functionality of this application are inspired by the Figma design provided. Every screen and widget is crafted to match the Figma layout with high fidelity, ensuring pixel-perfect design. This adherence to the design guidelines reflects the commitment to maintain visual consistency and user-centric workflows.

## Features

- Responsive Design using **Flutter ScreenUtil**.
- State Management and Routing with **GetX**.
- Drawer Navigation and Animation.
- Interactive Widgets such as Project Dropdown, Tasks Quick View, and Project Updates.

## About the Design

The application's interface is a true reflection of the user-first design approach demonstrated in the Figma file. The seamless transitions, balanced layouts, and intuitive navigation contribute to a clean and engaging user experience. By following the design closely, the application ensures visual consistency and usability across various screen sizes and devices.

From the **Project Dropdown** to the **Task Quick View**, each element is interactive and responsive, making it ideal for modern users. The integration of animations and transitions enhances user interaction while adhering to the design ethos provided in Figma.

By combining functionality with aesthetic appeal, this application ensures that users enjoy a cohesive and delightful experience.
